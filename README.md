# 🛠️ Self-Hosted

Welcome to **Self-Hosted Tools** — a collection of everything I’ve been hosting so far, shared openly for the community.  
This repo is meant as a **collaboration hub** where anyone can contribute ideas, configs, and scripts to make self-hosting easier, faster, and more secure.  

---

## 🚀 What You’ll Find Here
- **Docker Compose Files** → Quick setups for common self-hosted services  
- **Helm Charts** → Kubernetes deployments for scalable hosting  
- **Bash Scripts** → Automation for installing & managing tools  
- **Configs & Tips** → Nginx, SSL, reverse proxy, and monitoring tricks

## 📌 Roadmap
- [ ] Expand Docker Compose examples  
- [ ] Add security-hardened defaults  
- [ ] Collect monitoring/observability setups  
- [ ] Write docs for common self-hosted stacks (WordPress, Nextcloud, Vaultwarden, etc.)

## 🌍 Why This Repo?
I believe self-hosting should be:
- **Accessible** → anyone can spin up tools without guesswork  
- **Collaborative** → sharing knowledge saves everyone time  
- **Secure** → best practices included by default
